/**
 * Pure helpers for keyboard-driven device placement (#106).
 *
 * The keyboard flow arms a device (placement mode), then moves a U-slot cursor
 * within the focused rack with Up/Down and switches racks with Tab / Left-Right.
 * These helpers compute the valid cursor positions and the next cursor when a
 * key is pressed, plus the screen-reader copy. They take plain data (no stores,
 * no DOM) so the navigation maths is unit-testable.
 *
 * "Valid start positions" are the whole-U slots (1-indexed, human units) where
 * the device's bottom can mount without colliding or going out of bounds. The
 * cursor only ever lands on a valid slot, mirroring how the drag preview snaps
 * to a placeable position rather than letting the user hover an occupied slot.
