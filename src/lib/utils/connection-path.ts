/**
 * Connection Path Geometry
 * Spike #262: Cable Path Rendering Algorithm (issue #1931)
 *
 * Pure, DOM-free functions that turn two port anchors into renderable SVG
 * connection geometry: a cubic bezier path routed through an external
 * "channel" (gutter) to the left or right of the rack, and an optional
 * direction arrow at the path midpoint.
 *
 * This is the production implementation of the algorithm explored in
 * docs/research/connection-routing.ts (spike #262's externalChannelPath,
 * scored 5/5: "never crosses devices, clean visual hierarchy, natural
 * bundling"). The reference file is NOT imported from; the shape of the
 * options and the routing math is reproduced here deliberately, adapted to
 * this project's anchor/offset conventions (see port-geometry.ts) and split
 * into independently testable steps rather than one calculateConnectionPath
 * dispatcher.
 *
 * Anchor coordinates must come from port-geometry.ts's getPortAnchor(s) -
 * this module never computes a port position itself, only what to draw once
 * two anchors are known (buildPortAnchorMap below is the one exception: it
 * is a thin per-device loop around getPortAnchors, not a re-implementation).
