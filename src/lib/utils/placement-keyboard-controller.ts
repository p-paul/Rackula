/**
 * Keyboard-placement controller (#106).
 *
 * Wires the keyboard placement flow over the placement store and the layout
 * store. While a device is armed (placement mode) it owns the arrow / Tab /
 * Enter / Escape keys:
 *
 *   - Up / Down       move the U-slot cursor within the focused rack
 *   - Tab / Shift+Tab move between racks (Left / Right are aliases)
 *   - Enter / Space   place the armed device at the cursor
 *   - Escape          cancel placement with no side effects
 *
 * The cursor only lands on a valid (placeable) slot, mirroring how the drag
 * preview snaps. The controller drives the placement store's cursor and
 * announcements; the rack preview and the SR announcer read that store, so this
 * module never touches the DOM. The navigation maths lives in the pure
 * `placement-keyboard` helpers so it stays unit-testable.
