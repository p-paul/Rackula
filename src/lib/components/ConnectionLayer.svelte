<!--
  ConnectionLayer SVG Component
  Renders every Connection (#1931) whose ports both resolve to an anchor
  within this rack/face as cubic bezier paths, routed via the external
  channel algorithm (spike #262, src/lib/utils/connection-path.ts).

  Rendered by Rack.svelte as a sibling layer AFTER the device each-block, so
  it draws above every device body: PortIndicators renders mid-stack inside
  RackDevice and cannot draw a line that crosses from one device to another,
  which is why this layer lives at the rack level instead.

  Anchors come exclusively from port-geometry.ts's getPortAnchors (#3089),
  by way of connection-path.ts's buildPortAnchorMap - never recomputed here.
  A connection whose port has no anchor (grouped/high-density device, wrong
  rack face, cross-rack endpoint, container-child device (#3117), or legacy
  data with no PlacedPort match) is silently skipped rather than
  approximated; see buildRenderedConnections' doc comment for the reasoning.
