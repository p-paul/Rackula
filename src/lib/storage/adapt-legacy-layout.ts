/**
 * Carrier-first read-path adapter (#2290, epic #2158).
 *
 * Normalizes legacy layout data to the carrier-first model on load. Rails
 * register equipment at whole-U boundaries only; sub-U and half-width gear
 * mounts inside a container ("carrier") that registers to the rails. This
 * adapter runs at the single store ingress (loadLayout), so every load path
 * (file, API, archive, share decode, browser restore, YAML editor) passes
 * through it before the layout reaches reactive state.
 *
 * It also owns the legacy cables -> connections migration (#3091): the
 * deprecated Cable model (device id + interface name references) is no
 * longer part of the Layout type, but a prior-release file can still carry a
 * `cables` array. This adapter converts a resolvable cable into a Connection
 * (PlacedPort.id references) and drops an unresolvable one, so the legacy
 * key is still accepted on read even though it is never written again.
 *
 * It normalizes; it does NOT enforce. Schema/store enforcement lands in C4.
 *
 * Input is untrusted: share links and localStorage bodies reach loadLayout
 * without a full Zod pass, so every field is treated defensively. A malformed
 * device or rack is left as-is rather than throwing; a bad layout can never
 * block a load.
 *
 * The adapter is idempotent: loadLayout re-runs on every restore, so a layout
 * that is already carrier-first passes through unchanged (no double-wrapping,
 * no re-snap drift).
