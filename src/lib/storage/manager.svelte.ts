 * API available, and dismisses any lingering error toast.
 *
 * What is written back locally depends on which working copy is live when the
 * save settles, because the server base and the session slot are both single,
 * global slots that belong to whichever copy is open now:
 *
 * - Still the same layout, save finalized "stale" (clearDirtyState false,
 *   newer edits arrived while the PUT was in flight): the base still advances
 *   and the session is re-stamped with it, independent of clearDirtyState. The
 *   echo is this tab's own write against the layout that is still open, so the
 *   base must advance immediately, or a reconcile before the follow-up save
 *   fires sees false divergence against it and can discard newer local edits
 *   (#2926). Only the dirty flag and the session debounce are preserved for
 *   that follow-up save.
 * - The working copy was replaced (loadFromApi opened a different layout, or a
 *   reset swapped one in): dirty state, the base, and the session are all left
 *   alone. Loading does not bump the schedule id, so such a save can still be
 *   "current" by schedule id, but its echo describes a layout that is no longer
 *   open. Applying it would mark the new copy clean, hand its next save the
 *   wrong optimistic-concurrency timestamp, and write its session under a base
 *   that was never its own (#3151). The catalogue upsert is deliberately
 *   outside this guard: the PUT did reach the server, so the row for the layout
 *   it wrote is correct and is still recorded.
 * - The working copy was abandoned (deleted while the PUT was in flight):
 *   nothing at all is written back, the catalogue row included, since
 *   re-stamping the base or the session would resurrect state the user just
 *   deleted. See {@link abandonWorkingCopy}.
 *
 * When clearDirtyState is true (the default) and the working copy is still the
 * one that was saved: also sets status to "saved", marks the layout clean, and
 * cancels the pending session debounce.
 *
 * @param clearDirtyState Pass false for a stale debounced save whose captured
 *   snapshot is older than the live layout (newer unsaved edits arrived while the
 *   save was in flight). The dirty flag and session state are then preserved for
 *   the follow-up save so unload warnings and recovery data survive.
 * @param newUpdatedAt The server-echoed updatedAt from this save's PUT response.
 *   Becomes the base threaded into subsequent PUTs and stamped onto the copy.
 * @param completed Identity of the save being finalized: the snapshot it sent
 *   and the abandon generation it captured. Required for the catalogue upsert,
 *   which has nothing to record without the saved snapshot, and for the
 *   replaced-working-copy and abandoned checks, which have no identity to
 *   compare without it. Omitted by callers with no scheduling phase (tests

 * unknown-to-server and restore the layout the user just deleted. Callers run
 * {@link suspendServerAutosave} before the DELETE and this only once the
 * layout is actually gone.
 *
 * Two guards, because they suppress different things. Bumping the schedule id
 * (via suspendServerAutosave) marks any settling save stale, which suppresses
 * clearing dirty state and re-recording the server-catalogue row. That alone
 * is not enough: recording the base and re-stamping the working copy run
 * whenever the PUT echoes an updatedAt, independent of clearDirtyState
 * (#2926), so a settling save would write a fresh session copy of the layout
 * that was just abandoned, and the next reload would reconcile it as
 * unknown-to-server. Bumping the abandon generation is what stops that: a save
 * that captured an older generation writes nothing back at all.
 *
 * A PUT already on the wire is a separate problem, and a server-side one: it
 * still reaches the server, and if it lands after the DELETE the server
 * re-creates the row. That is closed by {@link awaitInFlightSave}, which the
 * delete flow drains before issuing its DELETE, not by anything here.
