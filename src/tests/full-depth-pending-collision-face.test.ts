/**
 * Full-depth placement preview and keyboard cursor honesty (#2925).
 *
 * The store derives a pending (not-yet-placed) full-depth device's collision
 * face as "both" regardless of which sub-view (front/rear) it is being placed
 * from - a full-depth device physically spans the whole rack depth. The
 * preview (resolveDropTarget), the drop-action resolver (resolveDropAction),
 * and the keyboard cursor (validStartPositions) must derive the same
 * collision face, or a full-depth device previews as valid over an existing
 * device on the opposite face and then gets refused by the actual placement
 * (same honesty class as #2854).
