# Rackula Data Schema Reference

**Schema Version:** 1.0.0 **Updated:** 2026-06-13 **Status:** Active

---

## Overview

This document is the authoritative reference for the Rackula v1.0.0 data schema. The schema defines the structure of device types, placed devices, racks, and complete layouts stored in `.Rackula.zip` archives.

**Key Characteristics:**

- **Flat structure** - No nested namespaces (removed legacy `Rackula:` namespace)
- **NetBox-compatible** - Field naming follows NetBox conventions (snake_case)
- **Lenient parsing** - Unknown fields are preserved (`.passthrough()` in Zod)
- **Component arrays** - Support for interfaces, power ports, device bays, etc.

**File Format:** YAML inside `.Rackula.zip` archives. See [SPEC.md](./SPEC.md) for archive structure.

## Schema Versioning and Compatibility Policy

This is the contract for how the layout format evolves and how readers behave across versions. Policy origin and full analysis: [spike #1113](../research/spike-1113-schema-versioning-policy.md).

### Version fields

| Field | Meaning | Authoritative for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `metadata.schema_version` | Data-format version, `MAJOR.MINOR` (current value: `SCHEMA_VERSION` in `src/lib/schemas/migrations.ts`) | Load / reject decisions. This is the only field a reader consults to decide loadability. |
| `version` (top-level) | App version that wrote or last-migrated the file (provenance) | The existing pre-0.7.0 position migration only. Nothing new keys off it. It is not renamed. |

Rules:

- Every writer must emit `schema_version`. Writers stamp `SCHEMA_VERSION`, but keep a newer same-MAJOR stamp so a resave from an older build does not misdescribe round-tripped additive data (#3108). A serializer test must assert that saved output always contains it, so a future writer cannot omit it and let a newer file masquerade as 1.0. This assertion is not yet in the suite; it is tracked with the reject-newer-major gate (#2205).
- On read, an absent `schema_version` in a YAML layout file is treated as `1.0` (every YAML file predating versioning is 1.0 by construction). This defaulting is scoped to the YAML parser, is a read-side allowance only, and is never produced on write. Payloads that carry no version marker by design (share-links) are not covered by this default.

### Reader rule (compatibility)

Gate strictly on `schema_version` MAJOR. Never gate on the app `version` (it bumps every release and would over-reject).

| Document vs app | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| Newer MAJOR | Reject, non-destructively. Never write the file. Tell the user the layout was made by a newer Rackula and to update; keep the original file untouched and offer to view the raw YAML. |
| Same MAJOR (any MINOR) | Load. Unknown additive fields are ignored by validation (tolerant reader). |
| Older MAJOR | Load and migrate (a MAJOR bump ships a migration from the previous MAJOR, with prior-version fixtures). |

Reject is the preferred failure over silently misreading data: it is loud, non-destructive, and recoverable.

### Additive vs breaking (run this at every release)

Five-point check. Any of remove / rename / retype / require / redefine on an existing field is MAJOR. Otherwise it is additive and MINOR.

| Change | Classification |
| --- | --- |
| New optional field, new optional top-level section, enum widening | MINOR (additive) |
| Remove or rename a field; change its type, units, or semantics; make an optional field required; restructure existing data | MAJOR (breaking) |

`cables` was additive (MINOR). The pre-0.7.0 position-units change would have been MAJOR. The `images` section (issue #617) is additive (MINOR): `schema_version` stays `1.0`.

### Measured widths stamp 2.0

`DeviceType.width_mm` (issue #3310) changes how a device fits a container cell, and a 1.x reader would treat a measured device as full width and reject its placement in a narrower cell. It is a MAJOR change, but it is stamped only when used: a writer stamps `2.0` (`MEASURED_WIDTH_SCHEMA_VERSION`) when any device type has `width_mm`, and `SCHEMA_VERSION` otherwise. A 1.x release then refuses a layout with measured devices with the "made by a newer Rackula" message, and still opens every layout without them. Removing the last measured device and saving restamps the file to `SCHEMA_VERSION`. Share links carry no version marker, so an older release that opens a link with a measured device ignores `wm` and may load it with that device treated as full width.

`DeviceType.height_mm` needs no stamp: `u_height` is still written, and a reader that does not know the measured height reads the rack units, which are correct. `PlacedDevice.rotation` changes a measured device's footprint, so a reader without it would reject a turned child as too wide for its cell. It applies only to measured devices, so a layout that uses it is already stamped `2.0`.

### Preserving additive data on save

Additive MINOR changes are only safe across builds if writers preserve sections they do not recognize. The serializer (`serializeLayoutToYaml`) emits a fixed set of top-level keys, so the format requires unknown top-level sections to be round-tripped: captured on read and re-emitted on save, so an older build cannot silently drop a newer build's additive section on resave. A section whose loss would be unacceptable and that cannot be round-tripped is a signal to make the change MAJOR instead.

### Enforcement surfaces

The reject-newer-MAJOR check lives at the shared validation ingress (`parseLayoutYaml` / `LayoutSchema`), covering file load and server GET. Two read paths are tracked as open work: the localStorage working copy is currently unvalidated, and share-link payloads carry no version marker. Both are follow-ups; until they get validation or a version marker, treat their inputs as unversioned rather than assuming they are safe. In normal use neither is a common cross-version vector (localStorage is same-build session state; share-links are regenerated on encode), but that does not substitute for the gate.

## Published Schema

A language-agnostic JSON Schema is generated from the Zod source and committed at `static/schemas/rackula-layout.schema.json`. It is the structural contract for the saved-layout format. Run `npm run generate-schema` to regenerate it after changing the Zod schema; a CI drift check fails if the committed artifact and the generated output diverge.

### Published URL and `$id`

The published name is evergreen: there is one schema file, updated in place as the format evolves. `static/` is served at the deployment root, so a tagged release publishes the artifact at the production URL, which is also the artifact's `$id`:

```text
https://count.racku.la/schemas/rackula-layout.schema.json
```

The committed file in `static/schemas/` is the source of truth, and the reader rule above works offline from `metadata.schema_version` regardless of whether the schema is served.

### Why the published name is unversioned

Schema evolution is additive by policy (MINOR changes above), and the generated schema is permissive about unknown fields, so the newest published schema keeps validating files written by older builds. Compatibility never hangs on this URL: readers gate offline on `metadata.schema_version` and never fetch the schema. If a breaking MAJOR change ever ships, freeze the final MAJOR-1 artifact from git history under a versioned name (for example `rackula-layout-v1.schema.json`) and publish it alongside. Until then, a version segment in the published name is unused complexity.

### Editor validation

To validate hand-edited layout YAML in an editor (VS Code, Neovim, JetBrains) against this schema, see the [YAML Schema Validation Guide](../guides/yaml-schema-validation.md).

## DeviceType

Template definition for devices in the library. Referenced by `PlacedDevice.device_type`.

### Field Reference

#### Core Identity

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `slug` | `string` | Yes | Unique identifier, kebab-case (e.g., `dell-r650`) |
| `manufacturer` | `string` | No | Manufacturer name (max 100 chars) |
| `model` | `string` | No | Model/display name (max 100 chars) |
| `part_number` | `string` | No | Part number / SKU (max 100 chars) |

#### Physical Properties

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `u_height` | `number` | Yes | Height in rack units (0.5-50, multiples of 0.5) |
| `width_mm` | `number` | No | Measured width in millimetres (positive) for gear that sits on a shelf or carrier. Marks the device as carrier-mounted and sets which cells it fits. Stamps `schema_version` 2.0 |
| `height_mm` | `number` | No | Measured height in millimetres (positive). `u_height` stays the rack units it takes. A quarter turn reads it as the device's width |
| `is_full_depth` | `boolean` | No | Full rack depth? (default: `true`) |
| `is_powered` | `boolean` | No | Device requires power? (default: `true`) |
| `weight` | `number` | No | Weight value (positive number) |
| `weight_unit` | `"kg"` \| `"lb"` | No | Weight unit (required if `weight` provided) |
| `airflow` | `Airflow` | No | Airflow direction pattern |

#### Image Flags

| Field         | Type      | Required | Description           |
| ------------- | --------- | -------- | --------------------- |
| `front_image` | `boolean` | No       | Front image available |
| `rear_image`  | `boolean` | No       | Rear image available  |

`front_image` and `rear_image` are boolean availability flags, not the image data. They record whether a face has a custom image; the bytes are stored separately depending on the storage mode.

#### Where image bytes are stored

The image bytes referenced by `front_image` and `rear_image` are not part of the schema fields above. Their storage depends on the mode:

| Mode | Where bytes live |
| --- | --- |
| Server-side persistence | On disk, one file per face, at `assets/{deviceId}/{face}.{ext}` inside the layout folder. The YAML holds only the boolean flags. |
| Browser, `.rackula.yaml` single file | Embedded in the YAML as base64 data URIs. |
| Browser, `.Rackula.zip` archive | Stored in the archive at `assets/{device_type-slug}/{deviceId}-{face}.{ext}`. |

In server-side persistence mode, no base64 image data appears in the stored layout YAML. For the on-disk layout, the per-asset and per-layout limits, and the snapshot behaviour, see the [Self-Hosting Guide](../deployment/SELF-HOSTING.md#custom-device-image-storage).

| Value    | Description                         |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `parent` | Parent device (e.g., blade chassis) |
| `child`  | Child device (e.g., blade server)   |

## Validation

### Key Constraints

#### Slug Pattern

Slugs must be lowercase alphanumeric with hyphens:

- Pattern: `^[a-z0-9]+(?:-[a-z0-9]+)*$`
- No leading, trailing, or consecutive hyphens
- Maximum 100 characters

**Valid:** `dell-r650`, `1u-server`, `usw-pro-48-poe` **Invalid:** `-server`, `server-`, `dell--r650`, `Dell-R650`

#### u_height

- Minimum: `0.5`
- Maximum: `50`
- Must be a multiple of `0.5`

**Valid:** `0.5`, `1`, `1.5`, `2`, `42` **Invalid:** `0`, `0.3`, `51`, `1.25`

#### Colour

- Pattern: `^#[0-9a-fA-F]{6}$`
- 6-character hex with `#` prefix

**Valid:** `#4A90D9`, `#ffffff`, `#000000` **Invalid:** `#FFF`, `4A90D9`, `rgb(255,0,0)`

#### Rack Dimensions

| Property        | Constraint         |
| --------------- | ------------------ |
| `height`        | 1-100 (integer)    |
| `width`         | 10, 19, or 23 only |
| `starting_unit` | 1+ (integer)       |
| `position`      | 0+ (integer)       |

#### PlacedDevice.position

- Minimum: `1`
- Must be an integer
- Must fit within rack height (position + u_height - 1 <= rack.height)

### Unknown Fields

The schema uses lenient parsing (`.passthrough()` in Zod), so unknown fields survive validation into memory on read and are not validated (any value accepted).

On save, the serializer re-emits fields through explicit ordering functions (`serializeLayoutToYaml`, `orderDeviceTypeFields`, and similar), which list known fields only. A genuinely unknown field is therefore not automatically written back. For forward compatibility the format requires unknown top-level sections to be round-tripped (see the Schema Versioning and Compatibility Policy above); for user-defined data on a device, use the dedicated `custom_fields` map, which is a known field and is preserved.

### Slug Uniqueness

All `DeviceType.slug` values within a layout must be unique. The schema validation checks for duplicates and reports an error listing all duplicate slugs.

## Version History

### v1.0.0 (Current)

- **Flat structure** - Removed nested `Rackula:` namespace from DeviceType
- **Field consolidation** - `colour` and `category` are top-level fields
- **Component arrays** - Added `interfaces`, `power_ports`, `power_outlets`, `device_bays`, `inventory_items`
- **Subdevice support** - Added `subdevice_role`, `parent_device`, `device_bay` fields
- **Extension fields** - Added `links`, `custom_fields`, `notes`, `serial_number`, `asset_tag`
- **Power properties** - Added `va_rating` for UPS devices
- **Lenient parsing** - Unknown fields preserved via `.passthrough()`

### Pre-1.0 (Legacy)

Earlier versions used a nested `Rackula:` namespace:

```yaml
# OLD FORMAT (pre-1.0)
device_types:
  - slug: dell-r650
    u_height: 1
    Rackula:
      colour: "#8BE9FD"
      category: server

# NEW FORMAT (v1.0.0)
device_types:
  - slug: dell-r650
    u_height: 1
    colour: "#8BE9FD"
    category: server
```
