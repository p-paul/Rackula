# Rackula Technical Overview

**Version:** 26.5.0 **Updated:** 2026-06-11 **Status:** Active

---

## 1. Overview

### Purpose

Rackula is a lightweight, FOSS, web-based rack layout designer for homelabbers to plan optimal equipment arrangement before physical mounting.

### Core Problem

"I have a rack and a pile of gear — I need to figure out the optimal arrangement before I start mounting."

### Target User

Homelabbers planning rack layouts. Desktop browser users for creation/editing, mobile for viewing.

### Design Principles

- **ADHD-friendly** — Minimal decision points, visual clarity
- **Lightweight** — Runs entirely in the browser; optional backend for persistence
- **Portable** — Layouts saved as self-contained `.Rackula.zip` archives
- **Multi-rack** — Support multiple racks per layout
- **Single-level nesting** — Containers hold devices but cannot be nested
- **FOSS** — MIT licensed

## 2. Deployment Modes

Rackula supports two deployment modes:

| Mode | Backend | Persistence | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Static** | None | File download/upload | Cloudflare Workers, static hosts |
| **Persist** | Hono/Bun | API server (save/load) | Self-hosted Docker |

In static mode, Rackula is a pure client-side SPA with no network dependencies. In persist mode, an optional API server provides layout storage, authentication, and multi-device sync.

See `CLAUDE.md` for deployment environments and CI/CD details.

### Mounting Model

Rackula models rack mounting carrier-first. This is a design principle: it decides where a device can sit and answers the recurring "why can't I place this at U5 1/3?" question with one authoritative rule.

Rails register equipment at whole-U boundaries only, matching the EIA-310 standard. A U is defined by three mounting holes; those holes locate the boundary of a unit, they are not alternative mounting positions. There is no real 1/3U or 1/2U rail position on a physical rack, so Rackula does not offer one. Rail positions are whole-U integers.

Devices smaller than a full U, or narrower than full width, do not bolt to the rails on their own. They mount inside a carrier: a bracket, tray, or shelf that occupies a whole U. The carrier registers to the rails at a whole-U boundary, and the small devices register to the carrier. A half-width pair, for example, is one carrier with two cells side by side. A MikroTik K-79 is a branded 2x2 carrier holding up to four small units in 1U.

The mounting rule:

| Device                                         | Mounts on |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| Full-width, integer u_height                   | Rails     |
| Sub-U height, non-integer height, or sub-width | A carrier |

Carriers are ordinary devices with a face and a whole-U position. A device with `u_height` below 1, a non-integer `u_height`, or less than full width cannot be placed on the rails directly; it must be a child of a carrier. This rule is enforced in the schema, in store placement actions, and in drag-and-drop targeting, so a fractional rail position cannot be reintroduced from any path.

A device is less than full width when it has `slot_width: 1` (half width) or a measured `width_mm`. Inside a carrier, a cell accepts a measured device when `width_mm` is no more than the cell's `width_fraction` of the rack's clear opening, plus 0.5 mm. Cells of 0.33, 0.34, 0.66, and 0.67 count as exact thirds. The clear opening is the published one where it exists: 222.25 mm (8.75 in) for 10", 450 mm for 19" (EIA-310 minimum), and 500 mm for 21" (ETSI ETS 300 119-3). 23" has no published opening and is approximated as the nominal width minus 1.25 in. Without `width_mm`, a half-width device needs a cell of at least 0.5 and a full-width device a cell of 1.0.

A measured device may also carry `height_mm`, from which its `u_height` is derived: the smallest multiple of 0.5U that holds it. A placed measured device can be turned in 90 degree steps. At 90 and 270 degrees its width and height swap, so every cell fit uses the device as it stands. Its generated carrier is reshaped with it: the cell is recut to the turned width and the carrier takes the whole U that holds its tallest child. An angle that does not fit is skipped.

Because a measured device's fit depends on the rack, a rack width change or a move to another rack is refused when a measured child would no longer fit its cell. A measured device too wide for a half-width cell gets no synthesized carrier; it can only be placed in an existing shelf or carrier with a wide enough cell.

Rationale: fractional rail offsets modelled a physical fiction and scattered paired half-width gear into impossible positions. Carrier-first keeps the data faithful to how equipment actually mounts, and gives sub-U devices a real parent rather than a floating coordinate.

Legacy layouts and share links that used fractional rail positions are adapted on load: positions snap to the nearest whole U, and sub-U or paired half-width placements are wrapped in an automatically synthesized carrier. The adaptation runs once on the read path. Older files open with their gear intact, now mounted in carriers the user did not place by hand.

### Constraints

| Constraint              | Value           |
| ----------------------- | --------------- |
| Min device height       | 0.5U            |
| Max device height       | 42U             |
| Min rack height         | 1U              |
| Max rack height         | 100U            |
| Allowed rack widths     | 10", 19"        |

| Max image size          | 5MB             |
| Supported image formats | PNG, JPEG, WebP |

### Interface Data

Device types can define `interfaces[]` port templates (see [SCHEMA.md](./SCHEMA.md) for the `InterfaceTemplate` shape). Interface data is optional; most starter and brand-pack devices are visual-only today. Brand packs (`src/lib/data/brandPacks/`) do not yet carry interface data; that population is tracked as deferred follow-up work (#260).

Starter library devices (`src/lib/data/starterLibrary.ts`) that ship with interface data:

| Device | Slug | Interfaces |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Switch (24-Port) | `24-port-switch` | 24x 1000base-t |
| Switch (48-Port) | `48-port-switch` | 48x 1000base-t |
| Half Switch (8-Port) | `1u-half-switch` | 8x 1000base-t |
| Fiber Patch Panel | `1u-fiber-patch-panel` | 12x 1000base-x-sfp |
| Patch Panel (24-Port) | `24-port-patch-panel` | 24x 1000base-t |
| Patch Panel (48-Port) | `48-port-patch-panel` | 48x 1000base-t |
| Half Patch Panel | `1u-half-patch-panel` | 12x 1000base-t |
| Amplifier (1U) | `1u-amplifier` | xlr-3 inputs, speakon outputs, rs-232 control |
| Amplifier (2U) | `2u-amplifier` | xlr-3 inputs, speakon outputs, rs-232 and management control |
| Audio Processor | `1u-audio-processor` | xlr-3 in, trs-1-4 out, aes3 out, dual dante, rs-232 control |
| AV Receiver (1U) | `1u-av-receiver` | hdmi in/out, rca aux in, rs-232 control |
| AV Receiver (2U) | `2u-av-receiver` | hdmi in/out, rca aux in, management and rs-232 control |
| Power Amplifier (3U) | `3u-power-amplifier` | xlr-3 inputs, speakon outputs, dual dante, management control |
| Streaming Encoder | `1u-streaming-encoder` | hdmi and sdi-bnc in, xlr-3 audio in, 1000base-t network |
| Video Switcher | `1u-video-switcher` | hdmi/displayport/vga in, hdmi out, rs-232 and management control |

### Collision Detection

Two rail-level devices collide if **both** conditions are true:

1. Their U ranges overlap (`position` to `position + u_height - 1`)
2. Their faces collide (see rules below)

Rail-level devices are all whole-U and full-width (see Mounting Model above), so there is no left/right slot dimension to compare at the rails. Sub-U gear lives inside carriers, where collision is checked per cell (see Container-Aware Collision below).

**Face Collision Rules (Face-Authoritative Model):**

The `face` property is the single source of truth for collision detection:

| Face A | Face B | Collision? |
| ------ | ------ | ---------- |
| both   | any    | YES        |
| front  | front  | YES        |
| rear   | rear   | YES        |
| front  | rear   | NO         |

**Key Principle:** If a device's `face` is explicitly set to `front` or `rear`, it only blocks that face — regardless of the device type's `is_full_depth` property.

**Role of `is_full_depth`:**

- Determines the DEFAULT face when placing a device
- Full-depth devices (`is_full_depth: true` or not specified) default to `face: "both"`
- Half-depth devices (`is_full_depth: false`) default to `face: "front"`
- Users can override face via EditPanel; the override takes precedence for collision detection

**Interface Position Constraints:**

Half-depth device types (`is_full_depth: false`) have a single physical face. Their interface templates cannot have mixed `position` values — all explicitly positioned interfaces must use the same face (`front` or `rear`). Unpositioned interfaces default to `front`. This constraint is enforced by `DeviceTypeSchema`.

**Interaction Consistency:**

Both drag-and-drop and keyboard movement use face-aware validation:

| Operation      | Validation Parameters              |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Drag-and-drop  | Target face from `faceFilter` prop |
| Keyboard (↑/↓) | Face from `placedDevice.face`      |

### Container-Aware Collision

Collision detection is hierarchical:

- **Rack-level:** Container devices collide with other rack-level devices using normal rules. Child devices (those with `container_id`) are invisible to rack-level collision.
- **Container-level:** Children only collide with siblings in the same container. Child position is relative (0 = bottom of container). Children must fit within the container's `u_height`.

| Device A            | Device B            | Collision Check          |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Rack-level          | Rack-level          | Normal U/face/slot rules |
| Rack-level          | Child               | Never collide            |
| Child (container X) | Child (container X) | Check within container   |
| Child (container X) | Child (container Y) | Never collide            |

Children inherit their parent container's face for rendering purposes.
